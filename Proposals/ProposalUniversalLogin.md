# Proposal Guideline 

## Project Overview

### Project name
Universal Login

### Team members 
Alex Van de Sande
Marek Kirejczyk


### What project are you building 
We are building tools for developers to help them onboard their users faster, easier and with as fewer dropoffs as possible.
Currently we built our own gasless, ens creating, metatransaction enabled, smart contract wallet, but we would like to migrate to Gnosis Safe. We want to make Gnosis Safe a part of a full onboarding solution for new users.

### Why did you decide to build it 
We understand that allowing users to pay for transactions or deployment of the contract is a real game changer. We built a system that counterfactually deploys a wallet, integrates with multiple onramping provider in many countries, and automatically register an ENS name for the end user. The signup can take less than 2 minutes (depending mostly on the onramp provider). We built it and launched from scratch, mostly because when we started Gnosis Safe was still under development. 

But now as many projects mature we are taking a deeper look on building on top of other mature projects and gnosis safe is a great alternative.

### How long will it take 
We estimate X months to complete the full transition.

### How much funding are you requesting  
US $50,000

### How did you hear about the GECO
We follow Gnosis developments closely and been to multiple Dappcons.


## Your Proposal 
### Project description
Our plan is to migrate completelly our SDK to Gnosis Safe. That would include a system that:
1) Allow users to log into apps by picking an ENS username
2) Deploying a contract and registering a new ENS name when it doesn't exist
3) Managing and registering new private keys when the account already exists
